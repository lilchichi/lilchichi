### Hola! 👋

- 🌱 Played around with the basics of html, css & javascript with [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- 📝 Writing basic explanations which referred to as [101's](https://github.com/lilchichi/101-s) of blockchain concepts, to re-enforce learning & maybe help other noobs be less nooby
- 👍 I like the idea of decentralisation & hope we can move towards a world where people have more freedom/liberty and hopefully aren't restricted (as much) by those in power
- ⚡ Fun fact: J'dore meme's
