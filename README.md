### Hola! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently **slowly** working on building a [community chat app](https://github.com/lilchichi/Chat-Community-App)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of javascript with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- 👍 I like the idea of decentralisation & hope we can move towards a world where people have more freedom/liberty and hopefully aren't restricted (as much) by those in power
- ⚡ Fun fact: J'dore meme's
